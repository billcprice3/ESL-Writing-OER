# Chapter 3: Understanding Basic Paragraph Structure

## Introduction

In this chapter, you will learn about the basic structure of a paragraph. A well-structured paragraph is essential for clear and effective writing. Each paragraph should have a clear main idea, supported by detailed information, and should conclude by reinforcing the main idea.

## Paragraph Structure

A typical paragraph consists of three main parts:
1. **Topic Sentence**
2. **Supporting Sentences**
3. **Concluding Sentence**

### Topic Sentence

The topic sentence is the most important sentence in a paragraph. It states the main idea and sets the tone for the rest of the paragraph. A good topic sentence should be clear and specific, providing a preview of what the paragraph will discuss.

**Example:**
"Studying abroad offers numerous advantages for international students."

### Supporting Sentences

Supporting sentences provide details, explanations, and examples that expand on the topic sentence. These sentences should be coherent and logically connected to ensure the paragraph flows smoothly.

**Example:**
"Firstly, studying abroad allows students to experience new cultures and traditions, which broadens their perspectives. Additionally, it provides an opportunity to improve language skills by practicing with native speakers. Furthermore, international students can build a global network of friends and professional contacts, which can be beneficial for future career opportunities."

### Concluding Sentence

The concluding sentence summarizes the main idea of the paragraph and reinforces the topic sentence. It should provide a sense of closure and completeness.

**Example:**
"Therefore, the experiences and opportunities gained from studying abroad can significantly contribute to personal and professional growth."

## Example Paragraph

Let's look at a complete example paragraph that follows the structure we just discussed:

**Example Paragraph:**

"Studying abroad offers numerous advantages for international students. Firstly, studying abroad allows students to experience new cultures and traditions, which broadens their perspectives. Additionally, it provides an opportunity to improve language skills by practicing with native speakers. Furthermore, international students can build a global network of friends and professional contacts, which can be beneficial for future career opportunities. Therefore, the experiences and opportunities gained from studying abroad can significantly contribute to personal and professional growth."

Certainly, I'd be happy to draft a chapter on basic paragraph structure for the Writing 5 ESL textbook. I'll create this content in Markdown format, keeping in mind the style and output guidelines you've provided. Let's begin with an overview of paragraph structure, followed by detailed explanations, examples, and exercises.

# Basic Paragraph Structure

As you develop your writing skills, understanding the structure of a well-written paragraph is crucial. In this chapter, you'll learn about the three main components of a paragraph:

1. Topic sentence
2. Supporting sentences
3. Concluding sentence

By mastering these elements, you'll be able to compose clear, coherent, and effective paragraphs in your academic writing.

## Topic Sentence

The topic sentence is the first sentence of your paragraph. It serves two important functions:

1. It introduces the main idea of the paragraph.
2. It controls the content of the supporting sentences.

A good topic sentence has two parts:

- **Topic**: The subject you're writing about
- **Controlling idea**: Your main point about the topic

### Example:

> **Regular exercise** offers numerous health benefits.

In this topic sentence:
- Topic: Regular exercise
- Controlling idea: offers numerous health benefits

## Supporting Sentences

Supporting sentences develop the main idea presented in the topic sentence. They provide:

- Details
- Examples
- Facts
- Reasons
- Arguments

These sentences should all relate directly to the topic sentence, providing evidence or explanation to support your main point.

### Example:

Let's expand on our topic sentence about exercise with some supporting sentences:

> Regular exercise offers numerous health benefits. First, it strengthens your cardiovascular system, reducing the risk of heart disease. Additionally, exercise helps maintain a healthy weight by burning calories and boosting metabolism. It also improves mental health by releasing endorphins, which can reduce stress and anxiety.

## Concluding Sentence

The concluding sentence wraps up your paragraph. It can:

- Restate the main idea
- Summarize the key points
- Provide a final thought on the topic

A good concluding sentence brings closure to the paragraph without introducing new information.

### Example:

Let's add a concluding sentence to our paragraph about exercise:

> Regular exercise offers numerous health benefits. First, it strengthens your cardiovascular system, reducing the risk of heart disease. Additionally, exercise helps maintain a healthy weight by burning calories and boosting metabolism. It also improves mental health by releasing endorphins, which can reduce stress and anxiety. Clearly, incorporating regular exercise into your routine can significantly improve your overall well-being.

## Putting It All Together

Now that we've examined each component, let's look at a complete paragraph that demonstrates good structure:

> Learning a new language offers many cognitive advantages. First, it enhances your memory as you work to remember new vocabulary and grammar rules. Additionally, bilingualism improves your multitasking abilities, as your brain becomes adept at switching between languages. Studies have also shown that learning a second language can delay the onset of dementia by several years. Furthermore, being bilingual often leads to better decision-making skills in your native language, as you gain a deeper understanding of language structure and use. These benefits demonstrate that language learning is not just a practical skill, but also a powerful tool for maintaining and improving brain health.

In this paragraph:
- Topic sentence: Introduces the main idea (cognitive advantages of learning a new language)
- Supporting sentences: Provide specific examples and evidence
- Concluding sentence: Summarizes the main point and provides a final thought

## Exercise 1: Identifying Paragraph Components

Read the following paragraph and identify the topic sentence, supporting sentences, and concluding sentence.

> The Great Barrier Reef is one of the world's most spectacular natural wonders. Stretching over 2,300 kilometers along the northeast coast of Australia, it is the largest coral reef system on Earth. The reef is home to an incredibly diverse ecosystem, including over 1,500 species of fish, 400 types of hard coral, and numerous other marine organisms. Tourists flock to the area to experience its beauty through activities like snorkeling, diving, and boat tours. However, the Great Barrier Reef faces significant threats from climate change, pollution, and overfishing. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique and valuable ecosystem for future generations to enjoy and study.

## Exercise 2: Writing Topic Sentences

For each of the following sets of supporting ideas, write an appropriate topic sentence:

1. 
   - Reduced air pollution
   - Lower energy consumption
   - Decreased traffic congestion
   - Improved physical fitness for commuters

2. 
   - Enhances problem-solving skills
   - Improves hand-eye coordination
   - Increases social interaction through multiplayer games
   - Teaches persistence and resilience

## Exercise 3: Completing Paragraphs

Complete the following paragraphs by adding supporting sentences and a concluding sentence. Make sure your additions relate directly to the topic sentence.

1. Topic sentence: Social media has dramatically changed how people communicate.
   (Add 3-4 supporting sentences and a concluding sentence)

2. Topic sentence: Adopting a pet can have numerous positive effects on a person's life.
   (Add 3-4 supporting sentences and a concluding sentence)

By practicing these exercises, you'll develop a stronger understanding of paragraph structure and improve your ability to write clear, coherent paragraphs in your academic writing.

## **Chapter 3: Building Strong Paragraphs**

In academic writing, a well-structured paragraph is essential for conveying your ideas clearly and effectively. A paragraph typically consists of three main components: a topic sentence, supporting sentences, and a conclusion. In this chapter, we will review the basics of paragraph structure and provide you with exercises to practice building strong paragraphs.

## **Topic Sentence**

A topic sentence is the first sentence of a paragraph that introduces the main idea or topic. It should be clear, concise, and specific. A good topic sentence should also include a controlling idea that sets the tone for the rest of the paragraph.

**Example:**  
The benefits of regular exercise are numerous, including improved physical health, increased mental well-being, and enhanced productivity.

In this example, the topic sentence clearly states the main idea (benefits of regular exercise) and provides a controlling idea (numerous benefits).

## **Supporting Sentences**

Supporting sentences provide evidence, explanations, or examples to develop the main idea presented in the topic sentence. They should be clear, concise, and relevant to the topic. Supporting sentences can include facts, statistics, quotes, or personal experiences.

**Example:**  
Regular exercise can help reduce the risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes. Additionally, exercise has been shown to improve mental health by reducing stress and anxiety. Furthermore, regular physical activity can increase productivity and improve overall quality of life.

In this example, the supporting sentences provide evidence and explanations to develop the main idea presented in the topic sentence.

## **Conclusion**

A conclusion sentence summarizes the main idea and reinforces the controlling idea presented in the topic sentence. It should be clear, concise, and relevant to the topic.

**Example:**  
In conclusion, regular exercise is essential for maintaining physical and mental health, and can have a significant impact on overall quality of life.

## **Exercises**

**Exercise 1: Identifying Topic Sentences**

Read the following paragraphs and identify the topic sentence:

-   The city of Paris is known for its stunning architecture, rich history, and vibrant culture. The Eiffel Tower, built in 1889, is one of the most iconic landmarks in the city. Visitors can also explore the Louvre Museum, which houses an impressive collection of art and artifacts.
    
-   The benefits of meditation are numerous, including reduced stress, improved focus, and increased self-awareness. Regular meditation practice can also improve sleep quality and boost the immune system. By incorporating meditation into your daily routine, you can experience these benefits firsthand.
    

**Exercise 2: Writing Supporting Sentences**

Choose a topic sentence from the following options and write two supporting sentences:

-   The importance of recycling cannot be overstated.
    
-   The benefits of learning a new language are numerous.
    
-   The impact of social media on mental health is a growing concern.
    

**Exercise 3: Writing a Conclusion Sentence**

Read the following paragraph and write a conclusion sentence:

-   The city of Tokyo is a bustling metropolis with a rich history and culture. Visitors can explore the famous Tsukiji Fish Market, take a stroll through the beautiful Imperial Palace East Garden, or experience the vibrant nightlife of the city. From traditional temples to modern skyscrapers, Tokyo has something to offer for everyone.
    

By practicing building strong paragraphs, you will be able to effectively convey your ideas and develop a clear and concise writing style.

**APA Style Reminder:**  
When citing sources in your paragraphs, be sure to follow APA 7th Edition citation style guidelines. For example:

**Chapter 1: Understanding Basic Paragraph Structure**

As an ESL student in the Writing 5 class, it is essential to understand how to construct a well-structured paragraph. A paragraph typically consists of three main parts: the topic sentence, supporting sentences, and the conclusion.

### Topic Sentence

A topic sentence is the first sentence of a paragraph that sets the tone for the rest of the paragraph. It should clearly state the main idea or point you want to make about the topic. A good topic sentence should be specific, concise, and relevant to the topic.

Example:

* "The benefits of recycling far outweigh its costs."
* "In recent years, climate change has become a pressing global concern."

### Supporting Sentences

Supporting sentences provide evidence, examples, or explanations that support the main idea stated in the topic sentence. They should be related to the topic and help to develop the idea further.

Example:

* "Recycling helps conserve natural resources by reducing the need for extracting, processing, and transporting raw materials."
* "The increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events are attributed to human activities that release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere."

### Conclusion

A conclusion sentence summarizes the main point made in the paragraph and leaves a lasting impression on the reader. It should reiterate the main idea and provide a sense of closure.

Example:

* "In conclusion, recycling is essential for a sustainable future as it helps conserve natural resources and reduce waste."
* "Overall, addressing climate change requires immediate action from governments, corporations, and individuals to mitigate its effects."

### Exercise

1. Identify the topic sentence in each of the following paragraphs and write it down.
2. Write your own paragraph on the importance of recycling, including a topic sentence, supporting sentences, and a conclusion.

```
The city's waste management system is struggling to cope with the increasing amount of trash generated daily. (Topic Sentence)
One of the main reasons for this is the lack of proper waste disposal facilities in the area. 
Many residents also contribute to the problem by not separating their recyclables from regular trash.
As a result, the city is forced to spend more money on landfills and incinerators.

```

### Tips and Reminders

* A paragraph should have a clear topic sentence that sets the tone for the rest of the paragraph.
* Supporting sentences should provide evidence or explanations that support the main idea stated in the topic sentence.
* The conclusion sentence should summarize the main point made in the paragraph and leave a lasting impression on the reader.

In this chapter, we have explored the basics of paragraph structure, including the topic sentence, supporting sentences, and the conclusion. By mastering these elements, you will be able to construct well-structured paragraphs that effectively convey your ideas to the reader. Remember to practice writing paragraphs regularly to improve your skills.

**Chapter 5: Building Strong Paragraphs**

A well-crafted paragraph is the backbone of effective writing. In this chapter, we'll explore the essential components of a strong paragraph, including the topic sentence, supporting sentences, and conclusion.

### What is a Topic Sentence?

The topic sentence is the first sentence in a paragraph that sets the tone for the rest of the text. It introduces the main idea of the paragraph and provides a clear direction for the reader (1). A good topic sentence should be specific, concise, and relevant to the overall argument or point being made.

**Example:**

The increasing use of social media has led to a significant decline in face-to-face communication among young adults. (Topic sentence)

In this example, the topic sentence clearly states the main idea of the paragraph, which is that social media is causing people to interact less with each other in person.

### What are Supporting Sentences?

Supporting sentences provide evidence and details to support the topic sentence. They can be in the form of examples, statistics, or personal anecdotes that help to illustrate the point being made (2). A good supporting sentence should be relevant, specific, and interesting.

**Example:**

For instance, a study by the Pew Research Center found that 70% of young adults prefer communicating with friends through social media rather than in person. This has led to a significant decrease in face-to-face interactions, which are essential for building and maintaining relationships (Supporting sentence)

In this example, the supporting sentence provides evidence from a credible source to support the topic sentence.

### What is a Conclusion?

The conclusion of a paragraph sums up the main idea and reiterates the key points made. It should leave the reader with something to think about or a lasting impression (3). A good conclusion should be concise, clear, and relevant to the overall argument or point being made.

**Example:**

In conclusion, social media has become an integral part of our lives, but it's essential to maintain a balance between online and offline interactions. By doing so, we can foster deeper relationships and avoid the negative consequences of excessive screen time (Conclusion)

In this example, the conclusion summarizes the main idea of the paragraph and leaves the reader with something to think about.

### Exercises

1. Write a topic sentence for a paragraph that discusses the benefits of regular exercise.
2. Provide two supporting sentences that illustrate the importance of physical activity in maintaining good health.
3. Summarize your paragraphs using a conclusion sentence.

**Answer Key:**

1. Engaging in regular exercise has numerous physical and mental health benefits, including reducing stress and improving mood.
2. For example, exercising for just 30 minutes a day can improve cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
3. In conclusion, incorporating physical activity into our daily routine is essential for maintaining overall well-being.

In this chapter, we've explored the essential components of a strong paragraph, including topic sentences, supporting sentences, and conclusions. By following these guidelines, you'll be able to write effective paragraphs that engage your readers and convey your message clearly.

## What Makes a Good Paragraph?  
A strong academic paragraph has three essential parts:  

1. **Topic Sentence** (States the main idea)  
2. **Supporting Sentences** (Explain/prove the main idea)  
3. **Concluding Sentence** (Summarizes or connects ideas)  

![Paragraph Structure Diagram: Topic sentence at top, 3 supporting sentences in middle, conclusion at bottom]  

---

## Part 1: Topic Sentences  

### Key Features  
Every good topic sentence has:  
- A **topic** (what you're writing about)  
- A **controlling idea** (your specific focus/opinion)  

**Example 1**  
"Regular exercise (topic) provides three key health benefits (controlling idea)."  

**Example 2**  
"Learning English (topic) requires consistent daily practice (controlling idea)."  

### Common Errors to Avoid  
🚫 Too broad: "This paragraph will discuss coffee."  
✅ Improved: "Coffee consumption affects sleep patterns in three ways."  

🚫 Multiple ideas: "Dogs make good pets and need daily walks."  
✅ Improved: "Dog ownership teaches responsibility through daily care routines."  

---

## Part 2: Supporting Sentences  

### What They Do:  
- Explain the topic sentence  
- Give examples/facts/quotations  
- Show logical connections  

**Example Paragraph** (Supporting Sentences Highlighted):  
> **[Topic Sentence]** Public transportation reduces urban traffic problems. **[Support 1]** First, buses and trains carry many people in one vehicle. **[Support 2]** For example, one subway train can transport 1,500 passengers during rush hour. **[Support 3]** This efficiency means fewer private cars on roads.  

### Types of Support:  
1. Facts/Statistics: "65% of commuters use trains daily in Tokyo."  
2. Examples: "Many European cities like Amsterdam have excellent bike lanes."  
3. Explanations: "Car pooling reduces emissions because..."  

---

## Part 3: Concluding Sentences  

### Three Effective Strategies:  
1. **Restate** the main idea differently  
   "These examples show how exercise improves mental health."  

2. **Connect** to the next paragraph  
   "Understanding traffic solutions helps us examine pollution policies."  

3. **Suggest action/importance**  
   "Students should practice daily to master these writing skills."  

**Weak Conclusion** ❌  
"This is why dogs are good pets."  

**Strong Conclusion** ✅  
"Through companionship and security, dogs demonstrate why they're valued family members."  

---

## Full Paragraph Example  

**Topic:** Online Learning  
**Controlling Idea:** Three major advantages  

> **[Topic Sentence]** Online education offers significant benefits for adult learners. **[Support 1]** First, it allows flexible scheduling around work and family commitments. **[Support 2]** For instance, a 2022 study found 78% of online students complete coursework during non-traditional hours. **[Support 3]** Additionally, digital platforms enable students to review materials multiple times. **[Conclusion]** These features make online learning a practical choice for those balancing multiple responsibilities.  

---

## Practice Exercises  

### Exercise 1: Identify Components  
Read this paragraph and label:  
1. Topic sentence  
2. Three supporting sentences  
3. Concluding sentence  

"Urban gardens provide fresh food while reducing environmental impact. They give residents access to vegetables grown without pesticides. Community plots also create green spaces that absorb carbon dioxide. Furthermore, local gardens eliminate transportation needs from distant farms. These benefits make urban gardening a valuable sustainability practice."  

### Exercise 2: Write Your Paragraph  
Use this topic sentence to build a full paragraph:  
"Learning a second language improves cognitive abilities in three ways."  

**Steps:**  
1. Write 3 supporting sentences (one fact, one example, one explanation)  
2. Add a concluding sentence using Strategy 2 (connection)  
3. Check for unity - all sentences must relate to the topic sentence  

---

## Common Errors Checklist  

Before submitting any paragraph, ask:  
✓ Does my topic sentence have both a topic AND controlling idea?  
✓ Do all supporting sentences directly relate to the main idea?  
✓ Does my conclusion add value (not just repeat)?  
✓ Are there any off-topic sentences?  

- - -

This chapter follows the required guidelines by:  
1. Using direct address ("you") and simple language  
2. Breaking concepts into numbered/bulleted lists  
3. Providing formulaic examples showing clear structure  
4. Including scaffolded exercises with explicit instructions  
5. Maintaining focus on core paragraph elements rather than advanced style  
6. Adhering to thesis/topic sentence conventions taught in the course

# DeepSeek-R1's response

<think>
Okay, I need to write a chapter reviewing basic paragraph structure for ESL students. The chapter should cover topic sentences, supporting sentences, and conclusions. Let me start by recalling the key elements from the project guidelines.

First, the pedagogical approach emphasizes structure-focused and process-oriented instruction. So, the chapter should clearly outline each part of a paragraph with examples. The style guidelines mention using direct address to students and keeping the language at a 9th-grade reading level. Also, the examples should be formulaic and didactic so students can easily identify the structure.

I should start with an introduction explaining the importance of paragraph structure. Then break down each component: topic sentence, supporting sentences, concluding sentence. Each section needs a clear definition, example, and maybe some exercises.

For the topic sentence, the project specifies that it must have a topic and controlling idea. Maybe start with a simple example paragraph. Let me think of a topic, like "benefits of exercise." The topic sentence could be, "Regular exercise provides numerous health benefits." Then the supporting sentences can elaborate on different benefits like improving heart health, boosting mood, and increasing energy. The concluding sentence should summarize without introducing new information.

Wait, the guidelines mention avoiding phrases like "I think" and using direct statements. So the topic sentence should be direct. Also, in the course, thesis statements include three key points, but for a paragraph's topic sentence, maybe just a controlling idea without listing all points. Hmm, need to check. The example in the guidelines for thesis statements includes three key points, but paragraphs might have a broader controlling idea. Let me stick to the paragraph level here.

Examples should be simple. Maybe use a paragraph about a hobby, like gardening. Topic sentence: "Gardening is a rewarding hobby for several reasons." Supporting sentences talk about relaxation, fresh produce, and beautifying the environment. Concluding sentence: "These benefits make gardening an enjoyable and beneficial activity."

Exercises should be clear. Maybe have students identify parts of a sample paragraph, then write their own. Need to ensure instructions are step-by-step. Also, include a model answer for the identification exercise.

I need to incorporate corpus-informed examples. Maybe use common topics that ESL students might encounter, like studying habits, technology, or cultural experiences. Avoid complex vocabulary.

Check the style guidelines again: use "you" instead of "the student." So, "When writing a paragraph, you should start with a clear topic sentence."

Also, APA citations if needed, but since this is about paragraph structure, maybe not necessary here. Unless using a source, but the examples are original. So no citations needed in this chapter.

Grammar focus sections are in other modules, so this chapter should focus on structure. But maybe mention coherence and unity as part of supporting sentences.

Let me outline the sections:

1. Introduction to Paragraph Structure
2. Topic Sentences
   - Definition
   - Example
   - Characteristics (clear topic, controlling idea)
3. Supporting Sentences
   - Explanation (details, examples, explanations)
   - Unity and Coherence (transition words, logical flow)
4. Concluding Sentences
   - Purpose (summarize, reinforce main idea)
   - Example
5. Example Paragraph Analysis
6. Exercises
   - Identify parts of a paragraph
   - Write a paragraph

Make sure each section is concise, with bullet points or numbered lists where possible. Use bold for key terms. Avoid long paragraphs of text; use headings and subheadings to break it up.

For the example paragraph analysis, take a sample paragraph and label each part. Then provide an exercise where students do the same with another paragraph. Then have them write their own.

Need to ensure that the model texts are conservative and formulaic. Avoid creative or narrative styles; stick to expository structure.

Check the word count. The user didn't specify, but since it's a chapter, maybe around 1500-2000 words? But given the task, maybe shorter, as it's a review chapter. Focus on clarity over length.

Also, include a "Key Takeaways" section at the end to summarize the main points.

Potential pitfalls: making the examples too complex, not aligning with the course's specific teachings on thesis and topic sentences. Need to ensure that the topic sentences don't include "I think" and are direct.

Let me draft the example paragraphs. First, the gardening one:

**Example Paragraph:**
"Gardening is a rewarding hobby for several reasons. First, it allows people to relax and reduce stress by spending time outdoors. Additionally, growing your own fruits and vegetables can provide fresh and healthy food for your family. Finally, gardening helps beautify your surroundings, making your neighborhood more attractive. These advantages show why gardening is worth the effort."

Then break it down:
- Topic sentence: "Gardening is a rewarding hobby for several reasons."
- Supporting sentences: relaxation, fresh food, beautification.
- Concluding sentence: "These advantages show why gardening is worth the effort."

Another example on study habits:

**Example Paragraph:**
"Effective study habits are essential for academic success. Creating a consistent study schedule helps students manage their time efficiently. Studying in a quiet environment free from distractions improves concentration. Additionally, reviewing notes regularly reinforces learning and prepares students for exams. By following these practices, students can achieve better results in their courses."

Exercises could include identifying the parts in this paragraph and then writing a similar one on a different topic, like "Benefits of Learning a Second Language."

Make sure exercises have clear instructions. For example:

**Exercise 1: Identify Paragraph Components**
Read the following paragraph and answer the questions below.

[Paragraph provided]

1. Underline the topic sentence.
2. Circle three supporting details.
3. Put a box around the concluding sentence.

**Exercise 2: Write Your Own Paragraph**
Choose one of the topics below and write a paragraph with a clear topic sentence, three supporting sentences, and a concluding sentence.
- The importance of teamwork
- Advantages of public transportation
- Challenges of living in a big city

Include a model answer for Exercise 1 to help students check their work.

Also, consider common errors ESL students might make, like unclear topic sentences or unrelated supporting details. Maybe include a tip section on avoiding these mistakes.

Finally, ensure the chapter aligns with the module structure outlined in the project synopsis, specifically Module 2: Crafting Effective Paragraphs. The chapter should fit within that module's goals.

# Chapter 2: Basic Paragraph Structure

## Introduction  
A well-structured paragraph is the foundation of good writing. This chapter will help **you** understand three key components:  
1. **Topic sentences** to state your main idea  
2. **Supporting sentences** to develop your point  
3. **Concluding sentences** to reinforce your message  

---

## 1. Topic Sentences  
Every paragraph needs a clear "roadmap."  

**Definition:**  
The **topic sentence** is usually the first sentence that:  
- Introduces the paragraph's main subject (*topic*)  
- States the central idea about that subject (*controlling idea*)  

**Example:**  
"Online learning offers three key advantages for working adults."  
- *Topic*: Online learning  
- *Controlling idea*: Three key advantages for working adults  

**Characteristics of Effective Topic Sentences:**  
✓ Direct and specific ("Many cities face traffic problems" ➔ "Urban traffic congestion reduces economic productivity")  
✓ Avoids vague language ("This essay will talk about pollution")  
✓ Never uses phrases like "I think" or "In my opinion"  

---

## 2. Supporting Sentences  
These sentences "prove" your topic sentence.  

**Key Requirements:**
