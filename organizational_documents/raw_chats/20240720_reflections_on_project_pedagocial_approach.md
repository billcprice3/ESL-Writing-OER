Today's context and task: 

PART ONE: I've been kicking around the concept of this project for awhile, but I'm experiencing some humbleness or trepidation about the execution. "Who am I to compile a writing textbook?"- that sort of thing. I've been teaching ESL writing courses for over a decade, and my own writing as a student was well received before that. I have my own set of opinions sculpted both by my own experiences and logic as well as by the writing paradigms I've encountered in various textbooks. There are expositions or pieces of advice in textbooks that I encounter and endorse approvingly; and there are others that I discard as unhelpful or even ludicrous. So I surely have my own intuitions and opinions in this field: yet, I feel a reflexive humbleness or impostor syndrome at codifying my approach. I am at a bit of a loss.

I believe that what would help me today would be a survey of pedagogical approaches to teaching academic writing (construed broadly as from the paragraph level to the full researched composition level) in English, and a sense of where I may fit in that landscape.

As an ESL writing instructor, one of my overarching concerns is to help bridge linguistic and cultural gaps that may impede comprehension-- both on the productive and receptive ends of that exchange. I drill students to expect structure, and practice skimming and scanning techniques with them to hone their appreciation for how authentic texts (such as academic journal articles) are organized in real life.

In some courses, I've used the textbook "Academic Writing for Graduate Students," and its corpus-based approach has been influential on my overall approach: if nothing else, especially at the highest proficiency levels, I think it is helpful to frame things as "this is what successful people really do" rather than just "this is what you should do".

And in the planning and execution of students' writing projects, I am quite dogmatic about the structure. I want one clear thesis statement- nothing split into multiple sentences. I want it to state the opinion directly, not couched in "I think...". I want every body paragraph to have a clear purpose: preferably its own topic and controlling idea that connects to the thesis statement, but failing that, at least a clear transition from one section of the paper to another. I don't like for students (in my specific assignments) to go on for multiple paragraphs about one body topic (key point); I want them to focus on making their arguments in a thoughtful, concise, and well-organized fashion.

However, I am not dogmatic about what students want to do in the future. I think of my role as ... let me try to think of an analogy. I dimly recall in the Karate Kid movie the trope of doing menial household chores in order to develop transferable skills for martial arts. Perhaps I view my role as a bit similar to that: I want to drill students on some fundamental skills that are relevant to any scale and type of writing, and I want my assessments not to show me that the student is a gifted writer, but to show me that the student can consciously deploy techniques and strategies that are helpful to a writer. What the student does with those techniques in the future is up to them: if they wish to craft conservative and careful prose, very well; or if they wish to craft more free-form or freewheeling prose, that's fine too, as long as they possess the skills to read their own prose critically, identify where readers may struggle to understand something, and deploy appropriate strategies such as (say) signal phrases to "keep the wheels on" their argument. 

I don't view myself as the editor (or advisor) on a serious real world project, but rather as more of a coach who is looking to instill (and observe the application of) fundamental strategies in the writing process that will better equip students to "swim under their own power" through their later projects.

I think, in general, my position is in alignment with the sorts of English teachers that I had when I was growing up. Some of them drilled structure heavily, but always, I think, with a mind toward "filling the student's toolbox" rather than trying to give students the genuine impression that a well-structured five-paragraph essay (for example) is actually the genre that they will (or ought to) write the most in life.

So, I'd like your feedback on all this: What are the shapes of the landscape of writing pedagogy? How should I talk about this project to others? What academic or industry terms in the field of writing pedagogy should I use? From what you can reasonably infer about my difficulties and insecurities in proceeding, what other context or advice may be helpful for me in getting this project rolling? Feel free to deploy this response as an artifact if that will facilitate better organization. (As you may know, Anthropic suggests submitting one gigantic prompt for multi-part tasks rather than building the task piecemeal in order to reduce computation, and I know this can come at a cost of focus or organization.)

PART 2:

I am deeply, keenly aware that the entire enterprise of writing is being upturned right now by the influence of generative AI. I am certain that many of my students have begun using generative AI tools over the last year and a half. I don't want to take a prohibitionist stance against it, but I also need an approachable, compelling way to talk about the issue and teach about the issue, not just in a broad philosophical sense, but in the most concrete down-to-earth sense as well. My general sense is that for someone like myself- someone who "learned the ropes" and has substantial domain knowledge- generative AI is a great tool for accelerating processes of drafting and ideation. But for a student, imprudent use of generative AI tools may interfere with processes of noticing and learning. I need to take these issues into account when putting this textbook together- it would be ludicrous of me not to, here at this moment in time- but I feel some trepidation at how to proceed with that. I suspect, for example, that if I incorporate "AI-assisted exercises" (in the sense of "use an AI to do task X") in my units, many instructors of the prohibitionist stripe will be aghast and refuse to use the materials. So perhaps segregating AI-related discussion and activities into its own unit would be more palatable to potential textbook users. I'm struggling to decide if I have a specific "ask" for you on this right now, but it is helpful to speak out loud to say that I know this is an issue on which I must be a pioneer of sorts. I can research and cross-reference the guides and statements being created by various universities, including my own; but fundamentally, that's different from writing a textbook designed for instructors to use to teach students, especially in a special context such as ESL. It's intimidating, and perhaps I have some level of fear that if I take a position (in this nebulous moment) that is later considered to be reprehensible, then this association may taint me and my career in the future. Or to put it differently: if I communicated a prohibitionist perspective, that would be safe, but likely to be viewed as "fuddy-duddy" in the future; yet if I make suggestions that are later considered (through experience or through cultural shifts) to be beyond the pale, I may be viewed as someone who "drank the kool-aid" or lacked foresight. But I suppose such risks are inherent in many tasks in which one must state a position, and that the stakes for something like a writing textbook are not particularly vertiginous.

# Writing Pedagogy Landscape and Project Contextualization

## 1. Overview of Writing Pedagogy Approaches

### Product Approach
- Focus on the final written product
- Emphasizes correct language use and text organization
- Often associated with traditional, form-focused instruction

### Process Approach
- Focuses on the stages of writing: prewriting, drafting, revising, editing
- Emphasizes the recursive nature of writing
- Encourages multiple drafts and peer feedback

### Genre Approach
- Focuses on different types of texts and their social contexts
- Emphasizes learning conventions of specific genres
- Often includes analysis of model texts

### Integrated Skills Approach
- Combines writing with other language skills (reading, speaking, listening)
- Emphasizes authentic language use across skills

### Corpus-based Approach
- Uses language corpora to inform instruction
- Emphasizes patterns of actual language use in specific contexts

### Critical Approach
- Focuses on social and political aspects of writing
- Emphasizes critical thinking and questioning of power structures

## 2. Your Position in the Landscape

Your approach seems to blend several of these pedagogical philosophies:

1. **Structure-focused**: Your emphasis on clear thesis statements, topic sentences, and overall organization aligns with aspects of the Product Approach.

2. **Process-oriented**: Your focus on planning, drafting, and revising reflects the Process Approach.

3. **Genre-aware**: Your use of "Academic Writing for Graduate Students" and focus on academic conventions shows elements of the Genre Approach.

4. **Corpus-informed**: Your appreciation for showing "what successful people really do" aligns with Corpus-based Approaches.

5. **Skills-transfer focused**: Your "Karate Kid" analogy suggests a focus on transferable skills, which is a modern take on writing pedagogy.

## 3. Framing Your Project

### Key Terms and Concepts
- Scaffolded instruction
- Metacognitive strategies
- Rhetorical awareness
- Transfer of learning
- Multimodal composition
- Writing across the curriculum

### Talking Points for Your Project
1. "This textbook aims to provide ESL students with a toolkit of transferable writing strategies."
2. "We focus on developing metacognitive awareness in writing, enabling students to adapt to various writing contexts."
3. "The approach balances structure-focused instruction with process-oriented techniques, preparing students for diverse academic writing tasks."
4. "By incorporating corpus-informed examples, we bridge the gap between prescriptive rules and actual language use in academic contexts."

## 4. Addressing AI in Writing Instruction

### Potential Approaches
1. **AI as a Tool**: Frame AI as another writing tool, like dictionaries or style guides, emphasizing responsible and strategic use.
2. **Critical AI Literacy**: Teach students to critically evaluate AI-generated content and understand its limitations.
3. **AI-Augmented Writing Process**: Integrate AI into specific stages of the writing process (e.g., brainstorming, outlining) while maintaining student agency.
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Use AI-generated text as a starting point for discussions on style, coherence, and argumentation.

### Implementation Suggestions
1. Include a standalone unit on AI and writing, covering ethical considerations, best practices, and limitations.
2. Incorporate optional AI-assisted activities throughout the book, clearly marked for instructor discretion.
3. Provide guidance for instructors on adapting exercises for both AI-inclusive and AI-free classrooms.
4. Emphasize the development of "AI-proof" skills like critical thinking, argumentation, and personal voice.

## 5. Moving Forward
1. Acknowledge the evolving nature of writing in the digital age in your introduction.
2. Position your textbook as a bridge between traditional writing instruction and emerging technologies.
3. Emphasize the development of foundational skills that remain relevant regardless of technological changes.
4. Provide flexible frameworks that allow for adaptation as AI technologies and institutional policies evolve.

Remember, your extensive experience as an ESL writing instructor gives you valuable insights. This textbook is an opportunity to synthesize your knowledge and adapt it to the changing landscape of writing instruction.

This overview should help contextualize your approach within the broader landscape of writing pedagogy and provide a framework for moving forward with your project. Here are some additional thoughts and suggestions:

1. **Addressing Imposter Syndrome**: Your years of experience and thoughtful approach to teaching writing are valuable. Remember that textbooks are often written by experienced educators like yourself who have developed effective strategies over time.

2. **Balancing Structure and Flexibility**: Your approach of teaching fundamental skills while encouraging future flexibility aligns well with current pedagogical thinking. This balance can be a key selling point of your textbook.

3. **AI Integration**: Your concerns about AI are valid and shared by many educators. Consider framing AI as a tool that students will encounter in their academic and professional lives, making it crucial to understand its proper use and limitations.

4. **Adaptability**: Design your textbook with modular units or sections that allow instructors to customize their approach, especially regarding AI-related content.

5. **Transparency**: Be open about your approach to AI in the textbook's introduction. This allows instructors to make informed decisions about using your materials.

6. **Ongoing Development**: Consider framing this textbook as a "living document" that will evolve with feedback and changing educational landscapes. This can help alleviate concerns about taking a definitive stance on evolving issues like AI in education.

7. **Collaboration**: Consider collaborating with colleagues or seeking feedback from other ESL writing instructors to refine your approach and gain additional perspectives.

Remember, your goal is to create a resource that helps students develop fundamental writing skills while preparing them for the evolving landscape of academic and professional writing. Your experience and thoughtful approach position you well to create a valuable contribution to the field.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspects of this overview or provide more detailed suggestions for moving forward with your project?
