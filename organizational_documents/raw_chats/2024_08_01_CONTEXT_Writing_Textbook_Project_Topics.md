## Info from the schedule overview

See the separate "W5 Schedule Overview 2244.docx" file. In particular, note that the course is roughly split between three types of skills: the "structural" skills (structure of paragraphs and essays, rhetorical patterns, signal phrases, etc); the "mechanics" skills (various clause types and grammar topics); and the "research/analysis" skills (finding and citing sources; data commentary). At least, in this moment, that's how I see the macro-level skill breakdown.

## New material to add: Generative AI component

Since I want this course to contain a generative AI component, I want a module of practical, concrete AI skills and exercises. I'm currently conceiving of this like a split between a textbook unit and an appendix: it would have its own internal logic and flow, but specific sections and activities could also be referenced as an optional component of other units. For example, if a given unit talks about prewriting for an essay, it could link to an activity in this generative AI appendix that focuses on an AI-assisted prewriting activity. That sort of thing.
