I'm working on the planning stages for a project that feels like it is growing quite "bushy". I would like your assistance in helping me refactor this project into a few different planning documents. Off the top of my head, I'm imagining these sorts of documents:

1. Instructions for an LLM to efficiently give it context and prepare it to perform a task in this project. (This will likely ALSO include most or all of the following materials as well, but it would be good to have a section really focused on helping the LLM understand how it should approach its task.)

2. A basic textbook outline, module by module, laying out the structure of the project. I'm still struggling a bit with this-- I suspect it would be best to have *some* amount of sequencing to follow the sequence of performance assessments expected to be completed in the course (paragraph structure before essay structure, for example; and a cause-effect essay before an argumentative essay). However, things like grammar topics don't need to be strictly ordered with regard to other materials. A rough plan is adequate for now.

3. A human-directed synopsis of this project, its pedagogical and philosophical approaches, and its distinguishing characteristics compared both to a traditional writing textbook and to a traditional for-profit textbook in general.

YOUR FIRST TASK, before we begin generating any documentation, is to suggest what documentation we SHOULD generate at this stage of the project. I have given my thoughts above: the LLM-focused instructions; the content plan; and the human-directed synopsis. I want you to reflect further on all the provided materials and context provided; make reasonable inferences about what a curricular designer would want to generate at this stage; and suggest any refinements or additions to this plan we should consider before proceeding.

Initial feedback:

4. The English Language Institute has sets of rubrics designed in committees for assessment, and it would be my assumption as a curricular designer that other institutes have their own assessment practices. In other words, I assume this is a question better handled by an individual institution or instructor rather than by the textbook. However, my assumption may be incorrect. In general, I think this points to the general "division of labor" I see: I am not designing a MOOC, but curricular materials. A MOOC needs to concern itself with the full implementation and assessment of the curriculum, but my current ambition is only to design materials.

5. My feedback to this is similar to #4: My current concern is the materials generation, and my hope would be for them to have broad applicability to be adapted to others' needs and contexts. I feel the implementation and evaluation is more for the end user.

6. This is a fair point-- but my assumption is that I will be generating any model texts rather than borrowing supplementary materials from elsewhere. Some appendices may point to, e.g., official APA resources. And I'm planning to make all materials Markdown-compatible, so I don't currently plan any (e.g.) HTML 5 activities or things like that. I want the materials to be suitable for printing and static display on a page. Which could, for example, suggest the appropriateness of QR codes where links may appear, etc, but that's a tertiary concern right now.

7. My own institute uses Canvas and Turnitin, but I would leave any details like this to the end user.

As such, although all of those suggestions could be highly germane in certain contexts, I don't think they have immediate applicability to this phase of my project (materials creation for general usage). I of course plan to make use of my own materials, but for that, I presuppose an institutional and assessment context that already exists, but that I wouldn't wish to impose on other users of the materials.

   - **Content**:
     - Detailed description of how the LLM should interpret and process the project's goals.
     - Guidelines for assisting in content creation and contextual adaptation.
     - Examples of expected interactions and outputs.

2. **Textbook Outline**:
   - **Purpose**: Develop a modular structure for the textbook content.
   - **Content**:
     - Outline each module with key topics, objectives, and content flow.
     - Emphasize the sequence of writing skills and strategies.
     - Indicate optional grammar and style topics that can be flexibly incorporated.

3. **Project Synopsis**:
   - **Purpose**: Provide an overview of the project’s educational philosophy and approach.
   - **Content**:
     - Description of the pedagogical goals and unique features of the materials.
     - Comparison with traditional writing textbooks and other resources.
     - Explanation of how the materials support flexible adaptation to different contexts.

4. **Supplementary Material Guidelines**:

   - **Content**:
     - Suggestions for model texts, examples, and additional resources.
     - Recommendations for integrating APA guidelines and similar references.

Write a second draft of the module plan that reflects this change, but with these alterations:

- Remove the Advanced Argumentative Techniques section
- Add a "Data Commentary" section sequenced before the "Crafting Argumentative Essays" section. I teach data commentaries as including a location and summary statement ("Figure 1 shows ..."); highlighting statements; and an argument section. I find that this is a useful paragraph-scale genre for introducing a core research writing technique and "warming up" into argumentative essays.

Let's take a step back. I forgot that we needed a module for generative AI.

There are some things that are obvious to include, like an overview of LLMs, the epistemological challenges (hallucinations/etc), and so on. But more directly, I also want to focus on very practical topics, such as the appropriate use of LLMs for processing and analyzing documents; for assessing one's own correspondence (such as email replies) for clarity and tone; as ideation, brainstorming, and drafting tools; and so on. There would also need to be a section about emerging policies related to generative AI in academic work-- I'd need to conduct this survey personally, but I'd be looking at things like university policies, APA policies, journal policies, and so on.

Please take these reflections and suggest a draft structure for a Generative AI in Writing module.
